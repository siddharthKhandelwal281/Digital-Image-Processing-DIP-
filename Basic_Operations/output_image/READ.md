# Output Images – Basic Image Operations

This folder contains the output images generated after performing basic image processing operations as part of the Digital Image Processing (DIP) laboratory work.

## Output Description

1. Original Image  
The original RGB image used as the input for all image processing operations.

2. Grayscale Image  
The RGB image converted into grayscale to represent intensity information.

3. Red Channel Image  
The image obtained by extracting only the red color channel from the RGB image.

4. Binary Image  
A binary image generated from the grayscale image using a fixed threshold value.

5. Histogram Equalized Image  
The image produced after applying histogram equalization to improve contrast.

### Random Matrix Generation
An 8×8 random matrix with values in the range 0–255 is generated to represent pixel intensity values of a grayscale image. This matrix is used to demonstrate image representation in Digital Image Processing.
