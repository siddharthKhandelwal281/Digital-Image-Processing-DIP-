# Output Images – Histogram Equalization

This folder contains the output images obtained after performing histogram equalization on the input image as part of the Digital Image Processing (DIP) experiment.

## Output Description

1. Original Image  
The original grayscale image before applying histogram equalization.

2. Histogram and CDF of Original Image  
Histogram showing the distribution of pixel intensities along with the cumulative distribution function (CDF).

3. Equalized Image  
The image obtained after applying histogram equalization, showing improved contrast.

4. Histogram and CDF of Equalized Image  
Histogram and CDF of the equalized image, indicating a more uniform distribution of pixel intensities.

## Observation
After histogram equalization, the contrast of the image is enhanced and pixel intensity values are spread over a wider range.
